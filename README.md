# Neural Signal Decoding with MLPs on PyTorch

Decoding brain signals using deep learning on the Haxby dataset within the PyTorch framework. Discover how non-linearities in Multilayer Perceptrons enhance decoding capabilities for complex cognitive processes.



## Project Highlights

- **Data Source**: We employ the Haxby dataset, a treasure trove of neural signals, as our foundation.
- **Model Architecture**: Our approach utilizes Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs) to capture the intricate relationships within the data.
- **Training and Testing**: We develop, train, and rigorously test our models within the PyTorch ecosystem.
- **Non-Linear Transformations**: Discover how the magic of non-linearities in MLPs enhances the model's ability to decode complex cognitive processes.

## Key Findings

As we delve into the core of our Multilayer Perceptron, we unlock its potential to comprehend and categorize neural signals. This model learns to distinguish between diverse categories such as "rest," "face," "chair," and more. With each training iteration, our model breathes life into the data, revealing its predictive prowess and its profound ability to decipher hidden stories within neural patterns.
